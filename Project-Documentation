Phase 1:
In Phase 1, we will divide the work into two sub-phases to allow for parallel development and efficient collaboration:

 Phase 1.1: (Handled by Ali Mohsen and Suleiman Jaber)
 Phase 1.1 will focus on the following components:

	. Main Menu
	. Grid Setup and Rules
	. Game Setup (Ship Placement)
	. Game Loop (Gameplay)
	. Handling User Input
	. Displaying the Winner and Ending the Game

 Phase 1.2: (Handled by Ghanem Zain and Mohamad Othman)
 Phase 1.2 will focus on game mechanics, including the following:

	. Grid Modification Logic
	. Fire Function
	. Radar Sweep
	. Smoke Screen
	. Artillery
	. Torpedo

This division allows each pair to focus on specific tasks, ensuring a more efficient workflow and a balanced workload for both groups. 
While tasks are distributed between the two pairs, the team will continue to function as a cohesive unit.

 General Notes:
	- The entire team will begin by collaborating on the Grid Logic, which forms the foundation for both Phase 1.1 and 1.2.
	- Each pair will take primary responsibility for their own task while actively collaborating with the other pair to exchange ideas and offer support as secondary contributors.
	- Collaboration between pairs is encouraged, provided it does not interfere with the progress of their own primary tasks.
	- Regular meetings will be scheduled to ensure that everyone stays aligned, progress is tracked, and overall team harmony is maintained.

This approach balances focus and collaboration, streamlining the development process while maintaining flexibility for cross-pair support.

For Phase 2 we had a couple of Challenges along the way, and we divided the Phase into a couple parts


Phase 2.1: Start with bot basics (Done by Ali Mohsen and Suleiman Jaber)
This phase was made to know all about how the bot should work and divide its main problems into easier subproblems, this included: 
	. Deciding which move to use 
	. Deciding where to hit
	. Logic of the bots decision making throughout the game
These 2 were complicated due to needing a lot of reasearch and complicated approaches such as the monte carlo simulation

Phase 2.2: Get the bot working (Done by Ghanem Zain and Mohamad Othman)
This Phase was made to find the ways that we should do the get the bot into action, this included:
	. Bot Ship Placement
	. Bot move decider implementation
	. Bot performing moves
This phase involved more of the frontend of the bot

Phase 2.3: Difficulties (Done by Suleiman Jaber and ALi Mohsen)
This Phase was purely to focus on the different strategies that we can utilise to have a couple of different difficulties with actual differnces, this included:
	. Using different probability grid functions (SlidingWindow and MonteCarlo)
	. Thinking of ways to make things easier for the end user (for easy mode)
	. Adding as much optimisations as possible (for hard mode)

Phase 2.4: Exaustive Testing (Done by the Team)
This phase included the entire team so that we test the code with all the possible testcases that we can find or think about. This made us balance out the differences between the difficulties and made the hard bot play as optimally as possible.

This all ensured an optimal output with a very powerful Bot in the end.
