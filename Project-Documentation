Phase 1:
In Phase 1, we will divide the work into two sub-phases to allow for parallel development and efficient collaboration:

 Phase 1.1: (Handled by Ali Mohsen and Suleiman Jaber)
 Phase 1.1 will focus on the following components:

	. Main Menu
	. Grid Setup and Rules
	. Game Setup (Ship Placement)
	. Game Loop (Gameplay)
	. Handling User Input
	. Displaying the Winner and Ending the Game

 Phase 1.2: (Handled by Ghanem Zain and Mohamad Othman)
 Phase 1.2 will focus on game mechanics, including:

	. Grid Modification Logic
	. Fire Function
	. Radar Sweep
	. Smoke Screen
	. Artillery
	. Torpedo

This division allows each pair to focus on specific tasks, ensuring a more efficient workflow and a balanced workload for both groups. 
While tasks are distributed between the two pairs, the team will continue to function as a cohesive unit.

 General Notes:
	- The entire team will begin by collaborating on the Grid Logic, which forms the foundation for both Phase 1.1 and 1.2.
	- Each pair will take primary responsibility for their own task while actively collaborating with the other pair to exchange ideas and offer support as secondary contributors.
	- Collaboration between pairs is encouraged, provided it does not interfere with the progress of their own primary tasks.
	- Regular meetings will be scheduled to ensure that everyone stays aligned, progress is tracked, and overall team harmony is maintained.

This approach balances focus and collaboration, streamlining the development process while maintaining flexibility for cross-pair support.
