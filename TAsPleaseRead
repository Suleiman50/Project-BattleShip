How to Navigate Our Files:
  1- The Folder named "Code" has all of the code that you need 
  2- The file "Bot.c" and its corresponding header file has most of the Phase 2 code (exception for "startBotGame()" which is in "BattleShip.c")
  3- In our Pdfs there is the project Report 
  4- Every other document else was for planning and collaboration purposes 

Things to note:
  1- You need to compile both files for the program to run (use "gcc BattleShip.c Bot.c -o game" then "./game" to run the file (make sure that this is the way for compiling on windows))
  2- the json file we have was due a compilation issue when we tried implementing Multi-threading, so you can remove it if it affects anything. But we heavily tested things and the program complied and ran on all of our machines.
  3- We always collaborated on Vs-code and used Liveshare to code together and only one person had to push (do not consider the person not active if he did not push)
  4- We tried our best to comment out everything we can to further explain what is going on because of the massive amount of code in the files
  5- Please make sure that your input is correct and you follow the rules we give you (though we tired our best to deal with invalid input)
  6- Please use the HARD MODE for the battle royale its the most optimal we made.
