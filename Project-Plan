Phase 1: 
For the first phase we will divide this phase into 2 different phase: 

- Phase 1.1: Which will be done by Ali Mohsen and Suleiman Jaber. (Done)
	Phase 1.1 Includes:
		- Main Menu
		- Grid Setup and Rules
		- Game Setup (Ship Placement)
		- Game Loop (Playing the game)
		- Handle user input
		- Display winner and end the game.

- Phase 1.2: Which will be done by Ghanem Zain and Mohamad Othman.
	Phase 1.2 Includes:
		- Grid Modification Logic
		- Fire Function
		- Radar Sweep
		- Smoke Screen
		- Artillery 
		- Torpedo

The entire team will firstly focus on the Grid Logic as it is the basis to both Phase 1.1 and 1.2

GRID LOGIC: 
 The Grid is a matrix of integers, every integer has its own meaning. Below are the integers and their corresponding state:
	0 --> Water 
  2 --> Ship size 2
	3 --> Ship size 3
	4 --> Ship size 4
	5 --> Ship size 5
	-1 --> Hit (Square had a ship) (Smoke screen ignores hit squares)
	-2 --> Miss (Square was hit but there was water)
	x10 --> Protected Square (Smoke Screen Effect)

PHASE 1.2 PLAN: (By Mohammad and Ghanem)

Function Names and Parameters:

Fire function: Takes coordinates and updates grid based on hit or miss
Name: fire
