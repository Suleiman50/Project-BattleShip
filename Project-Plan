The entire team will firstly focus on the Grid Logic as it is the basis to both Phase 1.1 and 1.2

GRID LOGIC: 
 The Grid is a matrix of integers, every integer has its own meaning. Below are the integers and their corresponding state:
	0 --> Water 
	1 --> Ship
	2 --> Protected Square (Smoke Screen Effect)
	-1 --> Hit (Square had a ship)
	-2 --> Miss (Square was hit but there was water)
