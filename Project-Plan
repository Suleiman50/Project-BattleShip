Phase 1:
For the first phase we will divide this phase into 2 different phase: 

- Phase 1.1: Which will be done by Ali Mohsen and Suleiman Jaber.
	Phase 1.1 Includes:
		- Main Menu
		- Grid Setup and Rules
		- Game Setup (Ship Placement)
		- Game Loop (Playing the game)
		- Handle user input
		- Display winner and end the game.

- Phase 1.2: Which will be done by Ghanem Zain and Mohamad Othman.
	Phase 1.2 Includes:
		- Grid Modification Logic
		- Fire Function
		- Radar Sweep
		- Smoke Screen
		- Artillery 
		- Torpedo

The entire team will firstly focus on the Grid Logic as it is the basis to both Phase 1.1 and 1.2

GRID LOGIC: 
 The Grid is a matrix of integers, every integer has its own meaning. Below are the integers and their corresponding state:
	0 --> Water 
	1 --> Ship
	2 --> Protected Square (Smoke Screen Effect)
	-1 --> Hit (Square had a ship)
	-2 --> Miss (Square was hit but there was water)

Function Names and Parameters:

Fire function: Takes coordinates and updates grid based on hit or miss
Name: fire
Return Type: int (1 for hit, 0 for miss, -1 for invalid move)
Function and Parameters: int fire(int grid[10][10], int row, int col);

Radar function: Checks if there are ships in a 2x2 area
Name: radar_sweep
Return Type: int (1 if ship found, 0 if not)
Function and Parameters: int radar_sweep(int grid[10][10], int row, int col);

Smoke Screen function: Protects a 2x2 area from radar detection
Name: smoke_screen
Return Type: void (no return, modifies grid)
Function and Parameters: void smoke_screen(int grid[10][10], int row, int col);
